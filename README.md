Dunbar-Janson-values.py provides three blended peicewise distributions calculated from the parameters provided by Dunbar and Janson:

- [Lower bound][μ (Mean/Median)][Upper bound]
- [100.2][147.8][231.1] (Dunbar)
- [22.73][ditto][446.2] (Janson)

Fuzzy-Dunbar-Janson.py is supposed to fit a continuous skewed version (not peicewise), but may need debugging.

Both scripts need review and clarification of assumption premises.
